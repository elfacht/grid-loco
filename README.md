A super flexible CSS grid using CSS grid and custom properties.
Create your grid in your modules or on the fly in the DOM without
stiff classes or mixins. Do what you want, but don't forget the omen!

This grid's crazy.

Heavily work in progress, no shame.
Release early, deploy often.
You need to chill.


## Roadmap

* Tell the people how to use this.
* Compiled CSS file for the purists.
* Fine, I'll do a demo.
* Add Soundcloud link.
* ðŸ‘€
